This script adds media-queries support to non capable browsers. It supports:

- em values
- min-width/max-width
- min-device-width/max-device-width

MQs obviously depends on Sheethub but also on [W](https://github.com/pyrsmk/W), a width management tool. Then, you can choose among 3 script versions ;)
