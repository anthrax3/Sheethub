Mqs 0.1.0
=========

This script adds media queries support to non capable browsers.

Features
--------

- px/em values
- min-width/max-width
- min-device-width/max-device-width
- resizing, zooming and text size changing will re-evaluate media queries for live responsive adjustment

Dependencies
------------

Mqs obviously depends on Sheethub but also on [W](https://github.com/pyrsmk/W), a width management tool. Then, you can choose among 3 script versions to minimize bandwith use and maximize simplicity ;)
