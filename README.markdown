Sheethub
========

Sheethub is a CSS API, bringing simplicity and centralization to polyfills, making them work together. In first place, it was developed for Respond and Selectivizr, then maybe other projects should use the API...

Advantages
----------
- tiny (3.9k uglified)
- robust (singleton design pattern, full unit testing set)
- cross-browser
- simplifies your polyfills

Disadvantages
-------------
- must be included aside the polyfills (with the singleton pattern you could inserted it to your library directly but we'll get an increase of the total size if many libs are used)
- if someone else see cons, please let me know...

Documentation
