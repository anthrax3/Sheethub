Sheethub
========

Sheethub is a CSS API, bringing simplicity and centralization for polyfills, making them work together. In first place, it was developed for Respond and Selectivizr. Maybe, other projects should use the API...

This, is published under the MIT (Expat) license.

Advantages
----------
- tiny, about 3.7k when uglified
- robust, with Jasmine (soon...)
- cross-browser (I hope...)
- implements the singleton design pattern

Disadvantages
-------------
- must insert the script with the CSS polyfills
- probably others ^^

Documentation
-------------
Coming soon...
